          Tracks the real-time location of each vehicle on a select CTA bus route. Behind the hood, the server uses setInterval() to send a json with all locations every 30 seconds. All of this is done through SocketIO.

          A tetris website I made for 2017 WebHacks. The most difficult part was by far creating the backend for the multiplayer mode, which relies heavily on sockets. There were 2 serious hurdles in the development process: creating a pairing system, and actually using that system to send the players their opponents' moves. I ended up using a global list as a queue, and random IDs that the server generates when a new user enters the loading page.

          This sites is unique in that it uses Jekyll, which is similar to a CMS, to generate all of its pages.

          My most complete game - a python 2D platformer. Its unique feature is that it uses a spritesheet to create each level, with the spritesheet's pixels representing actual blocks in the game.
