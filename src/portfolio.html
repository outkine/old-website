    CTA Map:

        - Node/Express, SocketIO
        - NGINX, PM2
      - >
        Tracks the real-time location of each vehicle on a select CTA bus route. Behind the hood, the server uses setInterval() to send a json with all locations every 30 seconds. All of this is done through SocketIO.
    NCP Code:

    Spice Dating:

        - React/Webpack
        - OAUTH2, Flask, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy
        - NGINX, uWSGI
      - >
        A (work in progress) dating app. New users are authenticated through Google OAUTH2 and taken to fill out a questionnaire. Their responses are sent back to the server and are stored in the database.
    Aesthetically Pleasing Tetris:

        - React/Webpack

        A tetris website I made for 2017 WebHacks. The most difficult part was by far creating the backend for the multiplayer mode, which relies heavily on sockets. There were 2 serious hurdles in the development process: creating a pairing system, and actually using that system to send the players their opponents' moves. I ended up using a global list as a queue, and random IDs that the server generates when a new user enters the loading page.
    (this site):
      - http://antonoutkine.com
      -
        - Jekyll
        - Github Pages
      - >
        This sites is unique in that it uses Jekyll, which is similar to a CMS, to generate all of its pages.
  Game Design:
    Ascension:
      - http://gamejolt.com/games/ascend/256642
      -
        - Python
        - Pygame
      - >
        My most complete game - a python 2D platformer. Its unique feature is that it uses a spritesheet to create each level, with the spritesheet's pixels representing actual blocks in the game.
    Gravity Arena:
      - http://gamejolt.com/games/gravityarena/256720
      -
        - C++
        - SFML
      - >
        Gravity-based space shooter.
    Battle Arena:
      - https://github.com/Jetmate/BattleArena
      -
        - C#
        - Unity
      - >
        A small 2D arena game I made with Unity.
  Misc:
    Chess Engine:
      - https://github.com/Jetmate/ChessEngine
      -
        - Python
        - Pygame
      - >
        Wrote it for a competition with a friend - essentially it works by simulating 4 moves into the game and choosing the one that gains the most material OR results in a better position.
